## When to Interrupt 

This repository includes the models we built for classifying a person is confused or not. 


`convert_to_video.py` - converts the images to the videos  
`data_preprocess.py` - seperate out and organise the images into their classes from labels  
`726_project_when_to_interrupt_group_3.ipynb` - google colab to test the differnet models  

The link to the data is - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pP-4TlC9HFPwO89v89RDssugid2u4UeT?usp=sharing

Update the path to the data accordingly in the `726_project_when_to_interrupt_group_3.ipynb`
